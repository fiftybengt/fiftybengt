My GitHub Manifesto
This GitHub is my commitment to staying in the loopâ€”continuously learning, building, and evolving.

I've always wanted to break into IT, but I often find myself exploring different technologies, starting strong, only to hit a wall. Initially, I focused on JavaScript and web development, but I ended up doing more design than actual coding.

Now, my motivation is clear: offensive security. Hacking has always intrigued meâ€”not just the act itself, but the knowledge, problem-solving, and creativity behind it. My goal is to complete courses, earn certifications, and develop myself into a genuine hacker.

The key to progress is consistency. I believe in small, daily effortsâ€”drops that eventually form a solid foundation. If I commit to improving every day, who knows where Iâ€™ll be in five or ten years? Mastery isnâ€™t built overnight, but with patience and persistence, I can get there. Step by step. Byte by byte.

This repository is a reflection of that journey.

Short-Term Goals:
1. Finish "Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course"

2. ðŸ—‚ Build a Knowledge Database â€“ A structured collection of notes, research, and insights on offensive security, hacking techniques, and IT fundamentals.
This will serve as a personal reference and a way to track progress as I learn.
