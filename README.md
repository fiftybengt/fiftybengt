My GitHub Manifesto
This GitHub is my commitment to staying in the loop—continuously learning, building, and evolving.

I've always wanted to break into IT, but I often find myself exploring different technologies, starting strong, only to hit a wall. Initially, I focused on JavaScript and web development, but I ended up doing more design than actual coding. While I enjoy coding and solving challenges on platforms like Codewars, my true passion lies in security.

Now, my motivation is clear: offensive security. Hacking has always intrigued me—not just the act itself, but the knowledge, problem-solving, and creativity behind it. My goal is to complete courses, earn certifications, and develop myself into a genuine hacker.

The key to progress is consistency. I believe in small, daily efforts—drops that eventually form a solid foundation. If I commit to improving every day, who knows where I’ll be in five or ten years? Mastery isn’t built overnight, but with patience and persistence, I can get there. Step by step. Byte by byte.

This repository is a reflection of that journey.
