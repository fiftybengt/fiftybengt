This GitHub is my commitment to staying in the loopâ€”continuously learning, building, and evolving.

I've always wanted to break into IT, but I often find myself exploring different technologies, starting strong, only to hit a wall. Initially, I focused on JavaScript and web development, but I ended up doing more design than actual coding,

Goals and commitments:
/ Finish "Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course" (paused)

/ ðŸ—‚ Build a Knowledge Database â€“ A structured collection of notes, research, and insights on offensive security, hacking techniques, and IT fundamentals.
This will serve as a personal reference and a way to track progress as I learn. -> https://fiftybengt.github.io/knowledgebase/
  * should keep this updated for everything tbh (!)

/ CS50W: HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP GIT PYTHON DJANGO JAVASCRIPT etc..(goal -a 2026)

/ Linux always

--> use less AI (its brainroot, but a good teahcer)
